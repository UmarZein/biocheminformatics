RESULT_DESCR,,,,,,,,"Indicates type of activity observed: inhibitor, activator, fluorescent, cytotoxic, inactive, or inconclusive.","Concentration at which compound exhibits half-maximal efficacy, AC50. Extrapolated AC50s also include the highest efficacy observed and the concentration of compound at which it was observed.","Maximal efficacy of compound, reported as a percentage of control. These values are estimated based on fits of the Hill equation to the dose-response curves.",Annotation/notes on a particular compound's data or its analysis.,Activity score.,"A description of dose-response curve quality. A complete curve has two observed asymptotes; a partial curve may not have attained its second asymptote at the highest concentration tested. High efficacy curves exhibit efficacy greater than 80% of control. Partial efficacies are statistically significant, but below 80% of control.",The logarithm of the AC50 from a fit of the data to the Hill equation (calculated based on Molar Units).,The Hill slope from a fit of the data to the Hill equation.,R^2 fit value of the curve. Closer to 1.0 equates to better Hill equation fit.,The asymptotic efficacy from a fit of the data to the Hill equation.,Efficacy at zero concentration of compound from a fit of the data to the Hill equation.,Numerical encoding of curve description for the fitted Hill equation.,"Which dose-response titration points were excluded from analysis based on outlier analysis. Each number represents whether a titration point was (1) or was not (0) excluded, for the titration series going from smallest to highest compound concentrations.",Maximum activity observed for compound (usually at highest concentration tested).,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,% Activity at given concentration.,"NCGC designation for data stage: 'qHTS', 'qHTS Verification', 'Secondary Profiling'"
